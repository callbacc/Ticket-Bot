# Discord-ticketbot

Bored of seeing those paid Discord ticket bots out there? You finally have a chance to self-host your own ticket bot just for free. This bot is exactly like that, it can create tickets, close tickets, add people in the ticket and lots more if you intend to modify it. After all it has the MIT license.

# Installation

npm install(make sure the package.json is there)

# Setup

1. Edit the config.json and edit whatever that matches your needs.

2. After that you would want to edit the files located in commands folder because you need to change the category name and the allowed roles in order for it to work.

# Commands

!new reason = creates a new ticket
  
!support reason = creates a new ticket
  
!help = the bot sends an embedded message with whatever commands you have added in the list
  
!ticket close, remove, add = either one of them, close should be executed in the channel, add should be executed in the channel and the user must be mentioned and same goes with remove
  
# Issues

If you are having any trouble running the script, you are free to open an issue and I will have a look.
